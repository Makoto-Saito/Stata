*Sometimes blood pressure is recorded as sBP/dBP in a cell (e.g. 120/65)
*This is not analysis-friendly
*Let's separate them for analysing the data

*separate sBP and dBP
generate splitat_bp = strpos(bp,"/") // identify the place separating by /. "bp" is the name for the blood pressure variable
gen sBP=""
replace sBP=substr(bp,1,splitat_bp-1)
gen dBP=""
replace dBP=substr(bp,splitat_bp+1,.) // "." means until the last digit
destring sBP dBP, replace
order sBP dBP, after(bp)
drop splitat_bp
